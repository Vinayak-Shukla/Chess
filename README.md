**CHESS**
Created a basic implementation of Chess using Pygame for the GUI.
Will continually improve the code, implementing more clean code theory to practice as well as adding more features which are currently missing from the game.

#TODO
* Create a start screen to pick format: Base, Chess960.
* ~~Implement Castling as well as En Passant.~~
* ~~Implement Stalemate.~~
* ~~Move the handle turns logic to a separate game class instead of the board class.~~
* Pawn Promotion
* Make this into a Chess Engine? AI? TBD.
